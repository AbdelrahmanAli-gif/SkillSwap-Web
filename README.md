# Swapoo

Swapoo is a **skill trading and learning platform** where users can teach and learn from each other.  
Our goal is to make learning more accessible by allowing users to **exchange skills** or pay for private sessions.  

We built **both a web app and a cross-platform mobile app**, so users can access Swapoo from anywhere.

## ‚ú® Main Idea
Swapoo connects people who want to **learn** with people who want to **teach**.  
Using AI, users are matched based on their skills, interests, and even location.  
Learners also get **AI-generated roadmaps (milestones)** to make the learning process smoother and more structured.  

In short: **Swapoo is a place to trade knowledge, not just money.**
